Hello everyone! For those who don't know me, I'm Raphael, founder of the Starbit Light team.\
I wanted to clarify a few things and give you some news concerning Starbit Light, our projects, and the future.


## What's going on with Nightlight Secrets?

The majority of you are here for this game. We know how hyped you are for knowing when the future update is coming up with the promised next acts since November 2021.

First of all, we are sorry for making you wait for so long! I feel like releasing the game in Early Access and wanting to release frequent updates to add more acts was a real mistake, especially for a game project that is being worked on free-time. This game is mainly supposed to be a story based game, where you follow the protagonist's life, complete various missions, travel through dreams and nightmares, and make strong decisions.

When I started the development of this game, I went in a completely blurry way and didn't know what the game was actually ending up being. It was late after, when I welcomed new amazing and talented members to the Starbit Light team, that I was really able to brainstorm something concrete and have a clear vision of what the game is going to be.

Since the Early Access release on Steam in November 2021, many things have changed. To start, we decided to revisit the overall story, but also the style of the game. We decided to go for a “less dark and edgy” style, and we even have chosen a brand new name for the game so it can finally be played by a larger range of player.

We can't wait to show you the impressive work we did over the past years on the full game. There's so much new stuff, new characters, new twists, new environments, and new music too! I know I'm increasing your hype even more, but you gotta be patient to see what we're cooking.

## Why does it take so long?

I founded Starbit Light to be a small team of people who are passionate into game development. We are working together on projects, but not all the time because we do this in our free time.\
Starbit Light isn't a video game company, this means that the projects we are working on are not our job and we are not earning anything from it for now.

<br>

## What about the other projects?

Our other projects (like *Extra Beat*, *Yuki's Kitchen*... and many other projects) are not even properly announced. For now, these are just side projects, and they are not our priority. We are trying to focus as much as possible on Nightlight Secrets so we can get it done as fast as possible for you, but at the same time we don't want to rush it and make a complete mess out of it that would disappoint the players.

<br>

## Now, when will we get a release date?

The answer is the same as it's been since years: **we don't know**.

As said above, we don't want to rush anything out, we are making sure everything is perfect so everyone can have an amazing experience while playing. Concerning Nightlight Secrets, no more updates will release for now until the full and complete story is done. I can't give you too much info about it, but I can just tell you that globally it's mostly just a matter of writing up the rest of the story, putting it in game, polishing a few things and preparing the rebrand everywhere. It's unknown how much time it will take, and we don't want to estimate anything too.\
We will announce proper release dates for any project whenever we are ready and feel like this is the right time to do so.

# Conclusion

I hope this message will reassure some of you who were doubting that Starbit Light was no longer active. Thank you for your time and your patience.
