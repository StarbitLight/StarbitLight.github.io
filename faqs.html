				<!--? SUICIDE FOR HIM -->
				<button type="button" class="collapsible filtered sfh">Why does Suicide For Him is in Early Access on Steam?</button>
				<div class="content filtered sfh">
					<p>
						Suicide For Him is being developed by a small team. So the early access is really important to deliver a satisfying and flawless gameplay depending on players' feedback and suggestions.
					</p>
					<p>
						By letting people playing an early access version of Suicide For Him, it is a great opportunity to get some feedback and suggestions while developing the full and final game.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<button type="button" class="collapsible filtered sfh">Approximately how long will Suicide For Him be in Early Access?</button>
				<div class="content filtered sfh">
					<p>
						This is too early to answer this question precisely, but the game would still be in early access for months, or a year as our team members are working on their free time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Suicide For Him will remain in early access until all the acts and game modes are fully implemented.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<button type="button" class="collapsible filtered sfh">How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?</button>
				<div class="content filtered sfh">
					<p>
						The final version of Suicide For Him is going to be better and stable than the early access version. In fact, we are working hard to optimize and improve the game as much as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						The final game will be polished: the animations, sounds design, 3D models, and gameplay features are going to be improved over the time. The game will also support some of Steam's online services, like Cloud Save, a bunch of Achievements, and much more.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please check the "Feature List" section on the Steam store page to get more detail about what the final game will have.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<button type="button" class="collapsible filtered sfh">Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?</button>
				<div class="content filtered sfh">
					<p>
						As the game is still in development and early access, we don't want the players to buy an unfinished game for a high price. We plan to gradually raise the price as we ship new content and features, until the game's development reaches its end.
					</p>
				</div>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible filtered sfh">Where can I listen to the game's soundtrack?</button>

				</div>

				<!--? EXTRA BEAT -->
				<button type="button" class="collapsible filtered extrabeat">What kind of game Extra Beat is?</button>
				<div class="content filtered extrabeat">
					<p>
						Extra Beat is a rhythm game that originally appeared as a minigame in our other game "Suicide For Him" which has been ported and optimized for mobile as a full game for free!
					</p>
				</div>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible filtered extrabeat">How can I unlock new beatmap packs in Extra Beat?</button>
