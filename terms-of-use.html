				</li>
				<li>
					Use any of our characters in an offensive way such as in some violent, gore, or sexual content.
				</li>
				<li>
					Make a fan-made content that is locked behind a paywall. As an example, fan arts should be visible without any purchase by all our players, or fan games should be free so anyone can enjoy it too.
				</li>
				<li>
					Suggest or state that your fan-made content is authorized or affiliated with Starbit Light.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>

				</li>
			</ul>
