				a limited, recoverable, royalty-free license to broadcast (i.e., upload and livestream) such
				Broadcasting User's unique play within the game, including the sound effects, the voice acts, and the
				soundtrack heard in the games as long as the Starbit Light team gets mentioned somewhere visible. Any
				usage of our work within another naming and branding is not allowed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The above limited license is subject to the following additional conditions:
			</p>
			<p class="dot">
