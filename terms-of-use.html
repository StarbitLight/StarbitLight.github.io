			<p class="num">3. Usage in Broadcast Gameplay</p>
			<p>
				Starbit Light believes that the Games are best served with soundtrack by an active and excited community
				of users. To encourage community growth and development, we hereby grant each user (‚ÄúBroadcasting User‚Äù)
				a limited, recoverable, royalty-free license to broadcast (i.e., upload and livestream) such
				Broadcasting User's unique play within the game, including the sound effects, the voice acts, and the
				soundtrack heard in the games as long as the Starbit Light team gets mentioned somewhere visible. Any
				usage of our work within another naming and branding is not allowed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The above limited license is subject to the following additional conditions:
			</p>
			<p class="dot">
				a Broadcasting User may create Broadcasted Content and distribute such Broadcasted Content on their
				website, or other websites, where anyone can view the Broadcasted Content for free.
			</p>
			<p class="dot">
				some acceptable forms of Broadcasted Content include, without limitation, let's play videos,
				walkthroughs, speedruns, tutorials, reviews, reactions, instructionals, and other videos which include
				your commentary.
			</p>
			<p class="dot">
				the Broadcasted Content must strictly comply with these Terms of Use, any applicable EULA, and the
				Privacy Policy of the broadcast platform.
			</p>
			<p class="dot">
				a Broadcasting User cannot disclose any unofficially released, unauthorized, or leaked video or content
				of any kind related to our games.
			</p>
			<p class="dot">
				Broadcasting Users assume all liability for ensuring their Broadcasted Content, and any monetization of
				Broadcasted Content, fully complies with all applicable laws, terms of use, policies, rules, and
				guidelines.
			</p>
			<p class="dot">
				Starbit Light may revoke a Broadcasting User's license to broadcast the Broadcasted Content for any or
				no reason and without notice.
			</p>

				soundtrack name and the Starbit Light team is getting a proper crediting.

				The usage of our soundtrack in other game projects or applications are not allowed, even if you credited
				Starbit Light or you are using it only for prototyping purposes, you may need to change the music you
				are using in your project.
			</p>
			<p>
				You agree not to sell any of our soundtrack and earn money from it. The only legit places to listen to
				our soundtrack are by our official websites, our socials, and music streaming platforms.
			</p>

			<p class="num">5. Remixes and covers</p>
			<p>
				If you're willing to upload a remix or cover of our soundtrack, you must abide that you may not be able
				to make money or gain any other financial benefit, except for the broadcast platform your content is
				published on. Your content must contain the right naming for the soundtrack (if any doubt on the
				soundtrack name, please contact us) and crediting to Starbit Light.
