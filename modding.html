			<h3>Last updated: January 31, 2025</h3>

		<div class="document-content">
			<p>
				We are always impressed by the mods creativity, it definitely helps for the life of the games community! We are totally encouraging modders to keep modding our games, however please take the time to read this page before releasing any modded content.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following policies applies to all of our games.
			</p>

			<h2><br>What is not allowed</h2>
			<p>
				We request that modders abide by the following restrictions:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Don't distribute a mod that isn't your own.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don't distribute or sell a mod that contains a paid copy of our game. (In the case you're distributing a mod, you must only share the modified files only, not the entirety of the game build)
				</li>
				<li>
					Don't use any of our characters in an offensive way.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don't suggest or state that your mod is authorized or affiliated with Starbit Light.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don't mod the games to add advertisements or add monetization features.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don't create hacks for our games.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don't distribute a mod that contains any malicious software or content.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2><br>What is allowed</h2>
			<p>
				Everything that is allowed concerning mods:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A distributed mod that does not include any of our base games (in the case it's a paid game). As an example, if you're modding Nightlight Secrets, you must only provide the modified files and players who want to play the mod must have a copy of the game they purchased.
				</li>
				<li>
					A mod with its source code distributed on platforms like GitHub (as long as the repository does not contain any of the game's base file or build).
				</li>
				<li>
					A mod that tweaks some gameplay mechanics. If the game contains online interactions, we encourage you to consider including custom third-party online services.
				</li>
				<li>
					A mod that includes a custom third-party online servers is totally allowed in the case the game you are modding have some online interactions. We encourage you to use custom servers if your mod changes any gameplay mechanics to avoid getting banned from the main game's online servers.
				</li>
				<li>
					A mod that changes some graphics. As long as only visual elements are tweaked out, if the game contains some online interaction it should be totally fine to be playing on the main game's online servers.
				</li>
				<li>
					A mod that translate a game in another language. Please note that official translations will be progressively added in our games over the time, so this is highly discouraged, but if this is for a finalized game that is no longer being updated feel free to do it.
				</li>
				<li>
					A mod that adds custom models or environments... If the game contains online interactions, we encourage you to consider including custom third-party online services.
				</li>
				<li>
					Distributing a mod for free and including a link to a supporter subscription website (like Patreon) or for donations for supporting the modder.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2><br>What is discouraged</h2>
			<p>
				The following are allowed, but we discourage you to distribute such mods:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A custom translation mod for early access games. We really appreciate your desire of playing our early access games in a language that is not natively available, but as our early access games are constantly getting updates and texts in game can be constantly getting tweaked out too any missing languages will be natively added over the time in free updates.
				</li>
				<li>
					A paid mod sold for a high price on distribution websites (like itch.io).
				</li>
				<li>
					A paid mod locked behind a paid tier on a supporter subscription website (like Patreon).
				</li>
				<li>
					A mod that tweaks gameplay features, but requires a donation or an active subscription to function.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<br><br>If you have any question, or you are not sure if your mod is allowed or not, please don't hesitate to contact us.
